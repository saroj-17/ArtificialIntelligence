# Artificial Intelligence Lab – CSIT

Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence Lab Repository. This collection of labs is designed to provide hands-on experience with fundamental and advanced concepts in AI using **Python** and **Prolog**. Each lab focuses on a key topic in AI, including intelligent agents, search algorithms, constraint satisfaction, logic programming, and machine learning.

##  Lab Overview

### Lab 1 (Python): Reflex-Based Intelligent Agent
**Objective:**  
- To design and implement reflex-based intelligent agents that make real-time decisions based on percepts from dynamic environments, such as traffic flow and presence detection.  
- To simulate environment-agent interactions using Python, demonstrating how agents can control systems like traffic signals and smart home lighting based on simple condition–action rules.

---

### Lab 2 (Python): Uninformed Search – BFS and DFS
**Objective:**  
- To understand and implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to explore state spaces and solve basic search problems.

---

### Lab 3 (Python): Informed Search – Greedy and A* Algorithm
**Objective:**  
- To implement Greedy Best-First Search and A* Search to find optimal or near-optimal paths using heuristic functions.

---

### Lab 4 (Python): Game Search – Minimax Algorithm
**Objective:**  
- To implement the Minimax algorithm for a two-player game like Tic-Tac-Toe, enabling an intelligent agent to make optimal moves by simulating all possible game states.  
- To understand the principles of adversarial search and decision-making in competitive environments.

---

### Lab 5 (Python): Constraint Satisfaction – N-Queens Problem
**Objective:**  
- To implement a solution for the N-Queens problem using backtracking and constraint satisfaction techniques.  
- To demonstrate how intelligent agents can systematically explore valid configurations while pruning invalid states to efficiently solve combinatorial problems.

---

### Lab 6 (Prolog): Predicate Logic and Family Tree
**Objective:**  
- To model knowledge using predicate logic in Prolog, implementing family relationships like `parent`, `sibling`, and `ancestor`.

---

###  Lab 7 (Prolog): Cryptoarithmetic Puzzle Solver
**Objective:**  
- To solve simple cryptoarithmetic puzzles like `SEND + MORE = MONEY` using constraint logic programming in Prolog.

---

###  Lab 8 (Python): Naive Bayes Classifier
**Objective:**  
- To build a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch for text classification or spam filtering.

---

### ⚙ Lab 9 (Python): Neural Networks – Logic Gates
**Objective:**  
- To implement a basic neural network model to simulate logic gates like AND and OR using the perceptron learning algorithm.

---

###  Lab 10 (Python): NLP Text Classification using scikit-learn
**Objective:**  
- To learn and implement essential Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflows using `scikit-learn`, including text preprocessing with TF-IDF vectorization, feature extraction, and building a text classifier to classify documents.  
- To understand the practical applications of NLP in machine learning.
